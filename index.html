      <p>Welcome to My Website! <br><br>I've made this website as a project that has helped me learn how to write HTML and CSS. All the code was written by me in Visual Studio Code, as well as most of the text, although the rest of the intro and some descriptive text was written with the help of a GPT. This is my first time working in VSC and first time using iframe and custom written code so keep your expectations low, as it might not be the best looking or the fastest website you have seen today. That being said, expect some cheesy puns and wording, and I hope you like the website. <br><br> Welcome to a delightful corner of the internet dedicated to celebrating two of the most versatile and beloved foods: cheesecake and sandwiches. Whether you have a sweet tooth or a craving for something savory, you've come to the right place. Dive into a world of flavors as I share my favorite foods and culinary experiences. From savory to sweet, each dish has a story and a special place in my heart. Whether you're a fellow food enthusiast or someone looking to discover new tastes, my website offers a delightful journey through my personal gastronomic adventures.</p>

    <h3 id="section-title">1.Cheesecakes</h3>
    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake">Cheesecake:</a> The Sweetest Whey to My Heart</h2>
    <p>Cheesecake boasts a rich history that dates back to ancient Greece, where it was served to athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776 BC. The Romans adopted and adapted the Greek recipe, creating a version called "libum" for religious offerings. Throughout the Middle Ages, cheesecake recipes spread across Europe, evolving with regional ingredients and techniques. The Renaissance saw the addition of sugar in England, making the dessert more refined. In the 18th century, European immigrants brought cheesecake to America, where cream cheese, invented in New York in the 1870s, became a key ingredient, leading to the famous New York-style cheesecake. Today, cheesecake has countless variations worldwide, from the light and airy Japanese soufflé cheesecake to Italy's ricotta-based version, remaining a cherished dessert across cultures and celebrations.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What makes a great cheesecake for me:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good quality cream cheese</li>
        <li>Biscoff crust</li>
        <li>Squeeze of lemon + lemon zest</li>
        <li>Raspberry swirl</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't think I remember the first time I had a cheesecake. Having grown up in Europe, I wasn't aware of the cheesecakes existance, and relied exclusively on deserts local to Bosnia to satisfy my sweet tooth. I do, however, remember that the first time I tried a cheesecake, I immediately fell in love. I always liked dairy products; greek yogurt, sour cream, kefir, milk and so on, so it came as no surprise that cheesecakes quickly became, and still are, my favorite desert. My wife Julia makes me a cheesecake every year for my birthday, and she likes experimenting with different flavors, which I absolutely love, although a classic cheesecake is still the GOAT.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What types of cheesecakes are there:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Classic Cheesecake
            <ul>
                <li>Smooth and Creamy</li>
                <li>Graham Cracker crust</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>New York Style Cheesecake
            <ul>
                <li>Denser than the classic cheesecake</li>
                <li>Graham Cracker crust</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Basque Cheesecake
            <ul>
                <li>Caramelized top with a burnt appearance</li>
                <li>No Crust</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fruit Topped Cheesecakes
            <ul>
                <li>Classic or New York-style base topped with fresh or cooked fruit.</li>
                <li>Graham Cracker or Biscoff crust</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Boulder, CO does not really have a lot of bakeries or good places to get cheesecake. One of my favorite ones you can get here is at a place called <b>"Piece Love and Chocolate"</b>. While the cheesecake itself is pretty good, it has a too-sweet sugar frosting that ruins the rest of it. Personally, I remove it before eating, but that is around 20% of the cheesecake. All in all, a solid 7.5/10, but it's nothing compared to a homemade cheesecake that my wife Julia makes.</p>

    <p>EDIT 10/08: My company just bought me a Costco cheesecake for my birthday today, and holy moly is it good. My wife didn't really like it because it is "too cheesy and yogurty tasting", but that is exactly the reason I love it so much. $18 for a whole (big) cheesecake, taste wise 9/10, value wise 10/10.</p>

    <h3 id="section-title">2.   Sandwiches</h3>
    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLT">BLT</a>: The Sandwich That's Bacon Me Crazy</h2>
    <p>The BLT (Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato sandwich) has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it didn't gain widespread popularity until the post-World War II era. With the advent of supermarkets in the 1950s, pre-packaged bacon and lettuce became more accessible, making the BLT a convenient and tasty choice for American households. By the 1960s, the BLT had cemented its place as a classic American sandwich, known for its simple yet delicious combination. Over time, variations like the BLAT (with avocado) have emerged, but the original BLT remains a beloved favorite.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have tried many, MANY, BLTs in my life. Every time my wife and I go to a new sandwich shop or a place that has a BLT or a variation of a BLT on their menu, I have to have it. Sometimes there are better options on the menu that sound more interesting, but the search for the perfect BLT comes first. I can always come back and have another thing, or, in case of one coffee/bagel shop that will remain anonymous, I will dispose of their poor attempt at a  "BLT" and order a garlic bagel with plain cream cheese.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px"><b>What makes a great BLT for me:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thin Crispy Applewood Bacon</li>
        <li>Lettuce - not too much</li>
        <li>Tomato seasoned with Salt 'n Peppa</li>
        <li>Good ol' Mayo</li>
        <li>Avocado, if I'm feeling it</li>
        <li>Cut into Triangles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If I had to pick one BLT that stood out to me for the creativity and the overall taste, it would have to be the BLT I had almost every day when working at <b>Model Bakery</b> in Saint Helena, California</p>

    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC">Banh Mi</a>: The Sandwich That's Pho-nomenal</h2>
    <p>The Bánh Mì is a Vietnamese sandwich that originated during the French colonial period in the late 19th century. French baguettes were introduced to Vietnam, and over time, locals adapted them to include traditional Vietnamese ingredients. By the mid-20th century, the Bánh Mì had evolved into a popular street food, featuring a mix of meats, pickled vegetables, cilantro, chilies, and pâté. Today, Bánh Mì is enjoyed worldwide for its unique blend of French and Vietnamese flavors.</p>

    <p>When it comes to Viatnamese food in Boulder, there are really only a few options , but a really good place our friends and us like to go to is called <b>Phở Kitchen Bar & Grill.</b></p>
    <p>We have also tried a place called <b>Vina Pho & Grill</b> which was also pretty good but nothing to write home about.</p>

    <br>
    <p>A place that really impressed me, both with the quality of food as well as the creativity, was a place called <b>ZOMO</b> in Denver. I had their mini Bánh Mì appetizers (my wife had the vegetarian ones) and for my entré  e I had a Viet Burger, which was probably the best Viatnamese food I have ever had.</p>
